Execution Roadmap (Prioritized by User Impact & Partner Readiness)
🔹 Week 1: Foundation Finalization

✅ ContentLicenseService.check_all()

✅ Display logic for protocol badges, prices

✅ Add per-source unlock API

✅ UI: “Discovery Mode” layout (React render logic)

✅ Claude summary display (fallback if no license)

🔹 Week 2: Monetization & UX

🔄 Per-source purchase → tie to LedeWire wallet

🔄 Bundle logic (dynamic or fixed) + savings display

🔄 Real-time license token issuance + cache fallback

🧠 Claude prompt tuning for academic & journalistic tone

✅ Add was_licensed → relevance boost logic

🔹 Week 3: Analytics Layer

🔄 SearchEvent, SearchResultInteraction, PurchaseEvent schema as implemented in SQLite (or log-based if easier)

🔄 Privacy-respecting tracking (UUIDs, session length, per-source feedback)

✅ Bundle CTR, unlock conversion, “like/dislike” feedback

✅ Early alert dashboard: Most-purchased sources

🔹 Week 4: Publisher Outreach Package

📊 Data summary for initial outreach:

Avg user spend

Most clicked sources

Bundle conversion rates

🧾 Sales deck + onboarding doc for publishers

🧪 Discovery UX: Key Decisions
Feature	Decision	Implementation Notes
Summary Preview	✅ Yes	Use Claude with 3-sentence summary or teaser
Protocol Badges	✅ Yes	Show RSL, Tollbit, Cloudflare (greyed if unavailable)
Unlock Buttons	✅ Yes	Per-source: $0.15 to unlock
Bundle Offer	✅ Yes	Show after 2nd interaction, bundle discount logic
Feedback Prompts	👍/👎	Per-source recommended for training & scoring
View Count	✅ Yes	Adds social proof (“read by 217 others”)
Hover Actions	Optional	Phase 2 – hover to show full summary or “preview first paragraph”
💳 Monetization Model Logic
🔁 Hybrid Approach
Mode	Details	Target UX
Discovery	Free summaries	Encourage browsing
Per-source unlock	$0.10–$0.50 range	Publisher earns + value clarity
Bundle purchase	Auto-offer when 2+ unlocks	Promote efficiency (“Save 25%”)

Recommendation: Use fixed discounts first (Save 25% on 3+ unlocks) — simpler to implement. Later can explore dynamic bundles based on protocol cost.

🔍 Relevance Optimization – Fast Impact Tactics

Immediate Relevance Boosts:

Licensed > Unlicensed

.edu, .org, .gov domain boosts

Titles with semantic match to query

Near-Term Personalization:

Preference scoring by user session

Revisit count or hover time → boost

Per-source “liked” status

Feedback Loop Signals:

👍/👎 → feedback triggers token or prompt

Feedback grouped by publisher → score over time

🛠️ Schema Enhancements (Tracking Quality over Time)

Add to SearchResultInteraction:

read_time_seconds: int
hover_time_ms: int
scroll_depth: float (0.0 - 1.0)


Add to PurchaseEvent:

bundle_id: UUID (nullable)
protocol_breakdown: object
    {
      "rsl": 2,
      "tollbit": 1
    }

🧠 Claude Prompt Optimizations (Examples)
User Type	Claude Prompt Template
Academic	"Summarize this for a university researcher looking to understand key arguments, citations, and methodology."
Journalist	"Summarize this for a reporter needing to quickly understand main claims, evidence, and controversy."
Consumer	"Give a quick overview for someone looking to get the gist of this article."
🔔 Final Decisions to Lock

Target vertical for launch?

✅ Journalism & Academic Research? (your current preference)

Bundle strategy:

✅ Fixed price per bundle or dynamic per protocol?

✅ Unlock UI: “Unlock all 3 for $0.99” (vs per-article unlock)

Anonymous → Registered Flow:

When to prompt for email? After 1st or 2nd purchase?

First licensing protocol to go live?

✅ RSL (most structured/easy to test) → others later?

🌐 Positioning One-Liner Suggestions

For academics:
“Search smarter. Pay only for the sources you need. Support open research access.”

For journalists:
“Micropayments for deep sources. Ethical AI-powered research for your next big story.”

For publishers:
“Turn AI into a revenue stream — not a threat.”
