Strategic Feedback
✅ 1. The “Source Mix Strategy” is the real win

Keep it, but make it data-driven, not rule-heavy for now.
Rather than rigid ratios (60/40 etc.), just store a lightweight source_type attribute (academic / journalism / business / government) in your enrichment metadata and let your backend sample proportionally when building the feed.

Example (pseudocode):

weights = INTENT_WEIGHTS[intent]  # {academic: 0.6, journalism: 0.4}
sources = pick_weighted_sources(all_results, weights)


✅ Benefit: Achieves diversity without new API calls.
⚙️ Effort: ~20 lines in backend aggregator.

✅ 2. Visual Badges — high payoff, negligible cost

Absolutely do this. It adds perceived sophistication at almost zero runtime cost.

Implementation tip:

Add a source_type_icon map in frontend (🎓, 📰, 💼, 🏛️ for government).

Keep colors subtle (e.g., gray/blue text next to the title).

Users will feel like the system curated intelligently even before they click.

✅ 3. Filter Chips — yes, but start simple

For MVP, these can be frontend-only filters. Don’t refetch data; just filter the in-memory results array.

results.filter(r => selectedType === "All" || r.source_type === selectedType)


Later you can hook them into backend search refinement, but this early version gives instant responsiveness and teaches users what “source diversity” means.

⚖️ 4. Intent Override — great UX, optional for MVP

Keep this in the design file but don’t implement immediately.
It adds clarity but requires storing user intent state across views.
For now, your “Focused on Academic + Business” badge already communicates the same idea.

🕒 5. Smart Temporal Mixing — good idea, but postpone

Temporal weighting adds complexity (you’ll need keyword detection + recency scoring).
Skip for MVP; add later when you start showing publication dates more visibly.
You can simulate it with a one-liner:

if "recent" in conversation_summary.lower(): intent = "news_event"


That’s enough for now.

🔧 Recommended MVP Build Order
Priority	Feature	Effort	Cost	Impact
1	Weighted source blending (backend)	🟢 Low	💲	🔥🔥🔥
2	Visual badges	🟢 Very low	💲	🔥🔥
3	Filter chips (frontend only)	🟠 Medium	💲	🔥🔥
4	Intent override text (optional)	🟡 Low	💲	🔥
5	Temporal mixing	🔴 Later	💲	🔥

→ Implementing just the first three gives you a tangible jump in perceived intelligence and “research feel” with virtually no additional model or API cost.

💡 Micro-UX Polish Suggestions

Use hover tooltips:
🎓 Academic → tooltip: “Peer-reviewed or institutional research”
📰 News → “Recent journalistic coverage”
Adds polish and trust with minimal code.

Badge in results header:
“🧭 Focused on: Academic + Business Analysis” → small, calm typography above filter chips.

Save user preference:
If someone switches to “News,” remember it in session so the system “learns” their style.

🧾 TL;DR for Your Agent

Let’s implement the blended-source logic, badges, and local filter chips first.
Skip temporal mixing and deep override UX for now.
This trio delivers immediate perceived intelligence, stronger trust, and zero extra model or API spend — a perfect MVP milestone.
