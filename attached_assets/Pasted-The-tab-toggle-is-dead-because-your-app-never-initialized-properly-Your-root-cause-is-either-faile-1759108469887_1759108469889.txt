The tab toggle is dead because your app never initialized properly.

Your root cause is either failed instantiation of the ChatResearchApp or missing event listeners due to:

🔥 Most Likely Cause:

window.app = new ChatResearchApp() never ran, or ran before the DOM was ready.

🚨 Here's how to debug it in 60 seconds:
✅ Step 1: Check if app exists

Open browser dev tools → Console → type:

window.app


If it returns undefined → 💥 You never instantiated your app.

If it returns ChatResearchApp {} → Move to step 2.

✅ Step 2: Check if event listeners are bound

Paste this in the console:

document.getElementById('researchModeBtn').onclick


If it’s null or undefined, listeners were never attached.

✅ Step 3: Verify DOMContentLoaded timing

Check where you’re calling:

document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
  window.app = new ChatResearchApp();
});


If your script is loaded as type="module" and at the bottom of the body, you may not need DOMContentLoaded. In fact, it might be too late.

Instead, try calling new ChatResearchApp() immediately if your script is at the bottom.

⚙️ How to fix it (pick ONE):
✅ Option 1: If your <script> is at the bottom of <body>

No need to wait for DOMContentLoaded:

window.app = new ChatResearchApp(); // call directly

✅ Option 2: If your <script> is in <head> or doesn't wait:

Keep DOMContentLoaded, but confirm ALL elements exist before calling:

document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
  const btnsExist = document.getElementById('chatModeBtn') &&
                    document.getElementById('researchModeBtn') &&
                    document.getElementById('reportModeBtn');
  if (btnsExist) {
    window.app = new ChatResearchApp();
  } else {
    console.error('❌ Mode buttons not found in DOM at init time');
  }
});

✅ Final Fix Plan

 Hard refresh your browser (clear script errors in cache)

 Confirm window.app exists

 Confirm buttons have event listeners

 Recheck script load timing vs DOMContentLoaded

 Consider manually calling initializeEventListeners() after confirming app instantiates
