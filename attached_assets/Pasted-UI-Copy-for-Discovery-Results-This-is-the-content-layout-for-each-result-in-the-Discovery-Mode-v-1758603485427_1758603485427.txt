Tracks full funnel conversion: search → click → payment

Captures per-source feedback loop for Claude summaries

Enables publisher reporting later:

"Your content was shown 900 times, clicked 270, purchased 63"

✅ MVP Implementation Tips

Track anonymously first (don’t require login)

Keep raw events in a queue or log (e.g., JSON to file or SQLite table)

You can implement delayed analysis (don’t need real-time dashboards yet)

Consider future export to Redshift or BigQuery for cohort analysis
