Immediate Go-Aheads
1. Toast Notifications

Yes, implement a lightweight toast system.

Don’t overengineer it — a basic implementation using a transient <div> that floats bottom-center is plenty.

Triggered manually in handleSourceUnlock() (for both success and failure).

Keep it visually distinct from system chat messages so it feels like a UI-level action rather than AI output.

Bonus UX Tip: Make toast auto-dismiss after ~3s and allow manual dismiss (e.g. clicking an “×”).

2. Unlock Flow State Management

Everything you outlined should happen inside handleSourceUnlock():

✅ Set a temporary "Unlocking..." state on the button (disable click)

✅ Call unlockSource()

✅ On success:

Set source.is_unlocked = true

Call appState.addPurchasedItem(sourceId)

Trigger a toast: ✅ Source unlocked! Redirecting you now…

Wait 1.5–2s

window.open(source.url, "_blank")

This achieves your goal of making the user feel like they used your system to unlock paywalled content and are now being rewarded with access.

3. SourceCard UI Update

The SourceCard logic should:

Check source.is_unlocked and display a "📄 View Source" button

Clicking it simply opens the source URL again (window.open)

Optional: add a badge or styling that visually marks it as “Unlocked”

This makes re-entry intuitive and reinforces the value of unlocking.

⚠️ Decisions You Need to Make:
1. Toast System Location

🟢 Recommended: Build it as a global component managed by App (or appState).

Could just be a simple array of messages with a timer.

2. Where to Store is_unlocked

✅ Yes, update the source object in appState.researchResults if that’s where cards pull from.

Also update addPurchasedItem() if that’s the canonical unlock store.

We just need to ensure that re-render triggers for any unlocked card. You may need a shallow copy to trigger the update (e.g., this.researchResults = [...this.researchResults]).

3. "View Source" vs "Reopen Article"

🟢 Go with "📄 View Source" — it’s clearer, more expected, and pairs nicely with "🔓 Unlock for $X".

4. Error Logging

✅ Log 422 details to the console.

❌ Don't show to user (MVP simplicity), just toast: ⚠️ Unlock failed. Please try again.

✂️ Things to Skip for Now (MVP Discipline)

No modal confirmations

No animated badge reveals

No undo flow

No deep unlock history UX

Just deliver a clean, obvious transition:
🔒 → ✅ → 🔗

✅ Final Verdict

You're right to prioritize feel over fidelity here. Even if the unlock is mocked or not truly paywalled, the psychology of transactional unlock + redirection makes it feel valuable.

Proceed with the toast-based flow and redirect UX. The backend is working, the frontend wiring is almost done — now it's just polish.
