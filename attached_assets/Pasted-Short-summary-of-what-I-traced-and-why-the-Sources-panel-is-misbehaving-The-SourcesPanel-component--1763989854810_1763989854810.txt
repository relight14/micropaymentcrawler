Short summary of what I traced and why the Sources panel is misbehaving

The SourcesPanel component is mounted into an element with id="sources-panel" (backend/static/js/components/sources-panel.js). The component renders its own innerHTML, toggles a visible class, and implements collapse + drag-resize behavior.

The CSS for the panel lives in backend/static/styles/components/sources-panel.css and sets .sources-panel { height: 100%; overflow: hidden; }.

Two key problems I found that will produce the symptoms you described (panel hidden / mis-sized / collapsing unexpectedly / not draggable):

Parent-height/layout problem: the panel CSS uses height:100%, but the parent container that should size the layout (the main content wrapper below the header) does not appear to guarantee a fixed height (calc(100vh - header)). When the parent has no explicit height, children with height:100% collapse to zero. That makes the left panel look “missing” or collapsed even though it’s present in the DOM.

Resize sign bug and collapse behavior:

In sources-panel.js, handleResize computes delta as startX - e.clientX and then sets newWidth = startWidth + delta. That inverts the direction of width changes (dragging to the right can shrink width). This causes surprising or broken resizing behavior.
The component’s render writes an innerHTML snapshot and expects toggle listeners to be attached afterwards. If toggleCollapse doesn’t set a collapsed class or set a small width, the panel visually disappears but the rest of the layout may not respect the intended widths.
The outline builder hides itself (outline-builder.js removes content when unauthenticated). If outline is hidden (or removed) the right column may be absent and flex behavior may shift things unexpectedly — so make sure the main layout is 3-column flex and each column can still reserve space when hidden (or use a collapsed placeholder).
Secondary items to check (these amplify the UI issues):

Ensure the sources-panel element exists inside the same main layout wrapper as chat & outline (siblings). If it’s appended elsewhere (or outside the layout), flex rules won’t apply and you'll get alignment issues.
Confirm the sources-panel stylesheet is loaded (network tab). If the markup is present but class names or rules changed, styles won’t apply.
Confirm that the code binds toggle/resize listeners after render (render sets innerHTML — listeners must be attached after that).
Concrete fixes (minimal, targeted changes) — exact patches you can drop in

Fix the resize direction bug and add robust collapse toggling in sources-panel.js
Change the delta sign (use e.clientX - this.startX) and implement toggleCollapse to add/remove a 'collapsed' class and set a sane collapsed width.

backend/static/js/components/sources-panel.js
/* patch: ensure resize direction is correct and collapse toggles set a class/width */

    /**
     * Start resize drag
     */
    startResize(e) {
Why this helps

Dragging right now increases width as expected; left decreases. Stop/remove listeners properly to avoid stale handlers.
toggleCollapse uses a collapsed class + inline width so the layout never collapses to 0 (prevents main chat from taking over unexpectedly).
Add defensive panel / layout CSS so the left panel is placed and visible (and collapsible) within a three-column flex layout
Ensure your main content wrapper (the element that sits below the header) uses a flex layout and a fixed height (so children using height:100% get a real height).
Add/adjust the SourcesPanel CSS: set default width, a collapsed class, and .visible behavior.

backend/static/styles/components/sources-panel.css
/* additions / adjustments for reliable layout */

.sources-panel {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    flex: 0 0 280px; /* fixed-ish left column by default */
Also ensure the main layout wrapper is a flex row with explicit height:


backend/static/styles/layout.css
/* New / ensure existence of layout rules for header + three-column layout */

:root {
  --header-height: 64px;
}

Why this helps

A fixed container height ensures .sources-panel { height:100% } produces usable height (not zero).
Using flex layout with explicit flex for left / center / right guarantees the three-column arrangement and predictable resizing.
Verify event binding timing and render side-effects
sources-panel.render assigns innerHTML each render. Make sure event listeners for the collapse toggle and resize handle are attached after render completes (I saw comments in the file — verify they actually run and bind to the elements returned by getElementById / querySelector).
If you replace the whole #sources-panel element at any point, reattach event listeners (or attach via event delegation on a stable ancestor).
If outline-builder hides itself by removing innerHTML when unauthenticated (outline-builder.js does that), make sure the main layout still reserves the right column (use a collapsed placeholder) so center and left don't reflow unexpectedly.
What to look for while verifying in the browser (quick checklist)

DOM structure: header + #main-content (parent) with three children: #sources-panel, #chat-panel, #outline-panel. If sources-panel is not a sibling, fix where it’s inserted.
Computed styles: select #sources-panel and verify width, height, display, flex-basis and parent height. If height is 0, inspect parent for missing height.
Console: any JS errors during init/render can abort the code that attaches toggle/resize handlers — fix those errors first.
Drag test: open DevTools, set a breakpoint inside handleResize and test dragging — confirm the delta is positive when dragging right.
Collapse test: click the collapse toggle — do you see class 'collapsed' added? Does panel size change but remain visible as a narrow bar?
Evidence / pointers from the code I used while tracing

sources-panel.mount and render flow, and the existence of startResize/handleResize (backend/static/js/components/sources-panel.js).
CSS uses height:100% for .sources-panel (backend/static/styles/components/sources-panel.css) — that needs a parent height to work.
outline-builder hides itself when unauthenticated by removing innerHTML (backend/static/js/components/outline-builder.js: render()) — that can change layout if not handled in CSS.
app.js wires search results to the panel (this.sourcesPanel.handleNewSources) so the panel will get content but must be visible and sized correctly to show it.
If you apply the three targeted changes above you should immediately see:

predictable left panel width and drag behavior,
collapse/expand that keeps a visible bar rather than removing the column entirely,
three-column layout below the header (left sources, center chat, right outline) with the chat occupying the center space.
If anything in your actual DOM or class names differs from the IDs/classes I referenced (e.g., main content wrapper id, header id, or the exact CSS filenames), adjust the selectors above to match.
