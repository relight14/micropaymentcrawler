MVP Priorities & Strategic Choices

Hybrid monetization model is the right move.
Per-source pricing plus bundled “research packets” lets you:

Show off your licensing system

Serve casual and power users

Offer instant, transparent value

Lead with vision, back it up with product.
Yes, many publishers aren’t yet live—but you’ve built a pipeline to the future. Messaging should be:

“The first AI research tool built for ethical access, publisher revenue, and reader ownership.”

Track interaction and feedback from Day 1.
Even with stubbed protocols, you can start collecting critical product signals:

Which content gets clicked

What people pay for

What they skip

How many come back

Push discovery as the core experience.
“Discovery mode” + “Click to unlock” is both delightful and scalable.

💰 Hybrid Monetization Model

Here’s how I’d structure this:

Mode	What User Gets	Cost	Ideal For
Discovery	Summary of top licensed/unlicensed hits	Free	Browsing, sampling
Per-source	Full article or PDF via license	$0.05–$0.25	Deep dives, one-click purchases
Research Pack	Curated 5–10 sources + summary	$1.99–$3.99	Full topic coverage, power users

Key user UX features:

Show per-source price in result list

Offer bundle pricing when >2 paid sources detected

Let users pick + pay in one click via wallet

🔍 Relevance Strategy for MVP

You already have Tavily, which is solid—but you can juice it for relevance:

Boost licensed sources (showing value of your system)

Track engagement:

Source clicked

Summary read

License purchased

Log results returned vs. results clicked (CTR proxy)

Ask for feedback: “Was this source helpful?” (emoji or thumbs)

Re-rank over time based on:

Clicks

Purchases

Feedback

🔧 MVP Implementation Tip:
Start by storing query → clicked url → license? → purchase? → rating? in your DB. You’ll be amazed what you can do with that data even before AI re-ranking.

🎯 Strategic Positioning

You have two winning narratives to run with:

1. For Readers:

“The search engine that pays publishers and works for you.”
Browse, preview, and unlock just what you need—with your LedeWire wallet.

2. For Publishers:

“The first AI tool that pays you when it learns from your content.”
Built on RSL, Tollbit, and Cloudflare protocols for fair compensation and opt-in access.

📈 MVP Success Metrics

Here’s what I’d track from Day 1:

Metric	Why it Matters
% of searches with licensed results	Measures protocol coverage
% of licensed sources clicked	Measures user interest in ethical content
Avg. spend per user/session	Core monetization stat
Top queries (by spend/clicks)	Early demand signal for verticals
Feedback scores on summaries	UX quality proxy
Return visits per user	Product-market fit indicator
🧪 Summary: What to Build and Ship Now

✅ Multi-protocol stubbed licensing engine

✅ Per-source pricing + purchase flow

✅ Click tracking and basic user behavior logging

✅ Basic UI/UX for research tiers + individual unlocks

✅ “Discovery mode” with free previews

And pair that with a landing message like:
