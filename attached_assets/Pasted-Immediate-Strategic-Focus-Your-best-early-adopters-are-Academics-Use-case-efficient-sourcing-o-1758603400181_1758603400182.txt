Immediate Strategic Focus

Your best early adopters are:

Academics → Use case: efficient sourcing of high-quality, primary research and licensed academic content.

Journalists → Use case: trustworthy sourcing of paywalled articles, deep reads for investigative work.

These groups:

Are mission-aligned with ethical content use

Already deal with licensing headaches

Are willing to pay small amounts for trusted sources

Will spread your vision if it works

🧭 Recommended MVP Flow & Decisions
1. 🔄 User Journey Transition (Tier → Hybrid)
Recommendation:

Replace “Basic” tier with “Discovery Mode” (free summaries)

Default to discovery → suggest a pack or per-source unlock

UI Flow:

User searches → see 6–10 discovery results

Each result shows:

Headline

2–3 line summary

Protocol badge + price

[Unlock for $0.10] button

If user clicks >3 unlocks, offer bundle:

“Unlock all 5 sources for $1.49 — Save 25%”

2. 📖 Discovery Experience Design

This is the most visible part of your MVP. Get this tight.

Best Format:
Element	Value
Headline	Familiar, clickable
Publisher name	Builds trust
Summary (2–3 lines)	Shows quality without giving away all
Protocol badge	Signals legitimacy
Price tag (if licensed)	Transparency
CTA button	“Unlock full article for $0.10”
Optionally: Add “Full Preview” on hover for licensed sources
3. 🎯 Licensed Content Promotion Strategy
Recommendation: Medium-aggressive

Show “Licensed Sources” first (e.g., top 2-3)

Badge them clearly: 🔒 “Publisher-approved”

Optional: Add soft messaging like “These sources support ethical AI research”

Don’t hide unlicensed results — just position licensed as the premium tier.

4. 📊 Analytics & Feedback Strategy
MVP Actions:

Track at source level:

Was summary viewed?

Was unlock clicked?

Was purchase made?

Was article marked “helpful” (👍 / 👎)

Track at session level:

Total queries

Number of paid articles unlocked

Return rate (cohort analysis)

Bonus (Post-MVP):

Offer 1¢ wallet credit for each feedback 👍

Let users “star” sources for follow-up

5. 🧱 Technical Stack Priorities
Feature	Build Now?	Notes
ContentLicenseService.check_all(url)	✅	Needed for every source in every query
Per-source unlock + pricing UI	✅	Adds visible, actionable value
Wallet purchase flow per article	✅	Already wired—just expose it
Behavior tracking DB entries	✅	Can be simple—just log query, action, timestamp
Relevance boost for licensed	⚠️ Soon	After logging behavior for a week or two
Real-time negotiation from RSL/Tollbit	❌ Defer	Placeholder fixed price is fine for now
📦 Timeline Suggestion
Week	Focus
Week 1	Discovery UI + Licensing metadata in results
Week 2	Unlock flow per source + LedeWire wallet payments
Week 3	Behavior logging + summary feedback loop
Week 4	Partner outreach with screenshots + mock user data
Week 5+	Relevance tuning, onboarding publisher licenses
🧠 Competitive Framing (Pitch Copy Suggestions)
