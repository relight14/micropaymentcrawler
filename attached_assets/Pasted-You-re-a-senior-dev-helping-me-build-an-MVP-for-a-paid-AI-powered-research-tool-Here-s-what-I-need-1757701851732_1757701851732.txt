You're a senior dev helping me build an MVP for a paid, AI-powered research tool. Here's what I need you to build:


🧠 App concept


It's a clean search interface that lets users research complex topics (e.g. “write a PhD thesis on cold fusion”).


The app previews 3 tiers of response before fetching any sources:


Basic = $1 for 10 sources


Research = $2 for 20 sources + outline


Pro = $4 for 40 sources + outline + insight


After selecting a tier and clicking “Pay Now”, the app:


Deducts the cost from the user’s LedeWire wallet via API (I’ll provide the wallet API).


Displays a research packet with:


Summary


Locked source cards (title + excerpt, not clickable yet)


Optional deep link buttons (e.g., “🔓 Read Full Source – $0.10”) that trigger future wallet calls.


⚠️ Important: Do not fetch live content yet. Simulate all source material and pricing for now.
Cloudflare's Pay-Per-Crawl API will be integrated later — assume it's not available during MVP.
Treat all sources as “locked” with simulated pricing, links, and quotes.


📦 App architecture (see file tree)
backend/
├── main.py               # FastAPI app entry
├── models.py             # Pydantic request/response schemas
├── crawler_stub.py       # Simulates priced content retrieval (no Cloudflare yet)
├── ledger.py             # Tracks what was shown or paid for
├── packet_builder.py     # Composes final research packet output
frontend/
└── index.html            # Clean UI: input, tier cards, Pay Now, result packet


✅ MVP Goals


Simulate /tiers endpoint → returns estimated cost for 3 response levels


Simulate /purchase endpoint → generates a mock packet


Stub wallet call (I’ll plug in LedeWire’s API later — just call /wallet/deduct)


Display packet with:


Summary


Locked source cards


“🔓 Unlock” button next to each source (UI only for now)


🔧 Stack Notes


Use:


Python 3.11+


FastAPI for backend


Simple HTML/JS frontend (React optional but not required for MVP)


If needed, use SQLite or in-memory for logging tier selections or fake ledger


LLM output and embedding logic should be simulated for now (LLM will be added later)


Here’s what a test user will be able to do:


User Experience Flow:


Land on a clean search page (like Google or Perplexity)


Enter a topic (e.g. “write a PhD thesis on cold fusion”)


See pricing tiers auto-populate:


“Basic: $1 — 10 sources”


“Research: $2 — 20 sources + outline”


“Pro: $4 — 40 sources + insights”


Click “Pay Now” using their LedeWire wallet


This simulates a wallet deduction (which you can already support via your existing backend)


View their custom packet:


Auto-generated summary


10/20/40 locked source cards (title, preview, "🔓 unlock for $0.10")


Wallet-driven unlock buttons (not functional yet, but illustrate future flow)


What it demonstrates:


💰 Pricing transparency & tier-based control


📦 What a research packet feels like — structure, depth, sourcing


🔒 Locked source system + unlock UX


🧾 Wallet-based monetization — no ads, no scraping, all fair & user-controlled


This is **enough to:


show partners what the product experience will be


onboard test users


collect feedback


and validate your pricing/packaging model**
