Short Answer Summary
Topic	Decision
RSL/Cloudflare Badges	C: Hybrid — show “Coming Soon” badges even if not actively licensed (demo mode)
Progressive Rendering Scope	Hybrid — improve backend flow now, upgrade frontend incrementally
Content Quality Ranking	Not MVP critical — skip for now, revisit after user behavior data
Purchase Integration	Mock it — show pricing, simulate flow, no real transactions
🧩 1. RSL/Cloudflare Badge Strategy

Should we show badges even when there's no live licensing response?

✅ Go with Option C: Hybrid

Tollbit → real pricing and badge only when license is confirmed

Cloudflare / RSL → always show "Coming Soon" badge (light gray or dimmed style)

Add tooltip: "Publisher uses RSL — licensing not yet active on this platform"

Why:

Builds credibility: Shows you’re protocol-aware, not scraping

Sets up a future unlock path for users

Signals to publishers that they’re supported

⚙️ 2. Progressive Rendering Scope

Should we go all-in on frontend refactor?

✅ Use a Hybrid Approach

Start with backend enhancements and light frontend tweaks:

Phase 1 (Now):

Tavily result → render immediately as "skeleton" card

Claude → updates card.description

Licensing → updates card.badge, card.price

Frontend Mini Plan:

Add updateCard(cardId, newData) method

Cards initially show loading... state

Animate update on description and badge arrival

Why:

Gets you most of the perceived speed benefit

Keeps engineering risk low for MVP

🧠 3. Content Quality Ranking

Do we prioritize licensed content over public content?

❌ Not MVP Critical

Skip this for now — your search engine (Tavily + Claude + relevance filter) is already strong.

Instead:

Always render licensed content with a visual badge boost

Keep fallback sources as-is

Later, once user data rolls in, we can:

Add behavioral boosting (“most clicked by researchers”)

Refactor the ranking model

💳 4. Billing Integration Depth

Do we integrate real wallet transactions?

✅ Mock Purchase Flow

For MVP:

Step	What it Does
Click “Unlock”	Shows fake modal: “You would be charged $0.25 to unlock”
Click “Build Report”	Simulate token spend, show confirmation
Wallet UI	Static balance + “Demo Mode” banner

Add this to UI:

💡 This is a preview of how licensed content access will work. Real payments coming soon.

Why:

Lets users explore full flow

Keeps you compliant (no payment = no licensing issues)

Easier to test publisher UX without risk

✂️ Things You Can Defer

If you're worried about over-engineering the MVP, here's what can wait:

Relevance scoring algorithms

Tiered license pricing logic

Fully dynamic inline citation linking

Wallet transaction ledger

Account linking / persistent purchase records

✅ Recommended Build Stack (MVP)
Layer	Feature
Backend	Tavily search → render
Backend	Claude summary (async)
Backend	Licensing discovery (async)
Frontend	Basic card with update hook
Frontend	Badge + price injection
Frontend	Modal for fake unlock / build report
UI Copy	“Coming Soon” messages, ethical access CTAs
Analytics	Track query, card views, unlock clicks (no ID required yet)
Final Word — This MVP Is Viable

This is a strong and realistic MVP. You're:

Respecting licensing boundaries

Offering free value up front

Laying groundwork for real micropayments

Sending a credible signal to both users and publishers

You don’t need a perfect backend or visual polish — just a clear value proposition, a few working demos, and mock flows to show where it’s going.
